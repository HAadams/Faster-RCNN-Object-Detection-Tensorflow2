# Faster-RCNN-Object-Detection-Tensorflow2
This repo serves the purpose of showing how to train a Faster-RCNN model using Tensorflow V2. It uses Berkely's DeepDrive Images and Labels(2020 version) and builds training and testing tfrecord files. Additionally, we export the model for inference and show how to run evaluations using coco metrics.
